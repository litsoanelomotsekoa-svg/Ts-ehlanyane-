                Ts'ehlanyane National Park is one of Lesotho's most beautiful natural reserves,
                located in the Maloti Mountains of Leribe District. This high-altitude park protects
                a rugged wilderness including rare plant species, indigenous forests, streams,
                and diverse wildlife. Visitors can enjoy hiking, birdwatching, horseback riding,
                and peaceful scenery in a pristine mountain environment. From high-altitude hiking
                trails to rare plants and waterfalls, the park is full of natural beauty. Birdwatchers
                and photographers will find the diverse wildlife especially exciting. One of the main
                attractions is the Maliba Lodge, an eco-friendly luxury stay inside the park with
                mountain views. Visitors can also enjoy pony trekking, guided nature walks, and scenic
                drives through mountain passes.
